# NS_Sequence_constant_ec_Data
Here are the data from the RNS code for sequences of rotating neutron stars with constant central energy density (All the files that start with "NS_data_").
The columns in each file are:
the central energy density (in 10^15 gm^-3), the total Mass (in solar masses), the baryon Mass (in solar masses), the initial total Mass (in solar masses),
the equatorial radius (in km), the Rratio (Polar radius divided by the equatorial radius), the initial radius (in km), the frequency (in Hz),
The Kepler frequency for this specific star (in Hz), the angular momentum (in solar masses), the kinetic energy (in solar masses), 
the gravitational energy (in solar masses) and the Rratio_S. Rratio_S is the same as the Rratio but by using the Schwarzschild-like metric.

We also give their EOS files (All the files that start with "eos").
